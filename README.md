# mattsavin.me

This is the source code for https://mattsavin.me/

It has been written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a superset of [JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) and runs on a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) server hosted for free on an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) [Elastic Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance.
The instance is running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) [Server 20.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/server) with [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) used as a reverse proxy for the production version of the Next.js server.

Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework developed by Vercel and based on React.js. Next.js uses core features of React such as components, whilst enabling the use of extra features such as server-side rendering.

## More about JavaScript

## More about React
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
React and React-based applications use a special syntax, namely JSX or TSX (for JavaScript and TypeScript respectively) for declaring components. JSX allows developers like me to easily combine JavaScript with HTML markup.
Although powerful on its own, however, React can only be used for state management and manipulation of the Document Object Model.

## More information about this project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
